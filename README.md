Be happy, for no reason like a child.

What if I can be happy only for a specific reason? 
It's quite possible I start looking for reasons to be happy as well as reasons to be unhappy.

I don't need a reason to be happy. I can be just happy, as I am, the way I am, now, here.

Do something about what I could do. Accept what I could not change.

Act happily.  Feel happy. Every moment with awareness, alertness and consciousness.

If something works, be happy. Something of worth is being done through you. 

If something does not work, be happy. As you can learn from others on how to make it work.

From 2018, today => Every day, every moment, I choose to be Happy. 

Remember always: 

1.  Remove the "I". It's not I. It's always the almighty. 
    I am an observer (watcher/witness), who observes the action by the actor and thoughts created/produced/activated in the mind unconsciously/consciously.

2.  Ego says, "Once everything falls into place, I will feel peace.".
    Spirit says, "Be at peace, and then everything will fall into place."

3.  I am not the body. I am not the mind. I am the watcher.
    Who am I?
    Who knows better than you? Search in you and find
    Remove the craving/longing desire.
